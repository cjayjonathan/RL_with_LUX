A GPU can also speed up the optimization part of RL training, but the rollout/interaction phase is CPU heavy in this tutorial and is typically the bottleneck.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Simplifying the Action Space\n\nThe action space is quite complicated in Lux S2 as each robot can move, dig, transfer/pickup, all in addition to being able to combine any sequence of these primitives into an action queue of up to length 20. For machine learning, such a massive action space leads to the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), making any ML algorithm have a much harder time to learn something useful, especially in RL.\n\nTo handle this, we can program a custom Controller that translates actions from one action space to the original action space and adds a few tricks and heuristics to be integrated with RL training. Since the original lux action space is large, this controller can be a little complicated. For those who want to dive straight into training you can use the controller as is. \n\nFor a high-level overview this controller will\n- Define a massively simplified action space\n- Translate actions from the discrete action space into the Lux S2 action space `action_to_lux_action`\n- Add a heuristic factory action to build one Heavy robot\n- Generate action masks where False = an action is invalid\n\nOverall, the action space of the controller is a discrete action space with just 12 dimensions to control just one heavy robot. It allows for a robot's 4 directional movement, transferring ice in 4 directions in addition to center, picking up power, digging, and a no-op action. This doesn't include factory actions, self destruct, recharging, transferring other types of resources, or longer planned action queues in the action space, which are all open problems for you to potentially tackle!\n\nThe controller also includes a trick to allow agents to reduce power costs incurred by action queue updates. The controller skips updating action queues if the existing action queue is the same as the new one the agent wants to use for the robot.\n\nWhile this simplification doesn't include adding in more complex things like more heavy robots or planting lichen, it will train out a succesful policy that with simple modifications, will beat the majority of bots using the rule-based starter kits.\n\nMore advanced usages can consider how to model the actions of different types of units on a game board (e.g. heavy, light, or factory) by using a MultiDiscrete action space. A more practical and likely winning solution can be to use a image-like controller by generating actions for each tile on the board and only using the actions with friendly units on that tile. See [Season 1's solution by ToadBrigade](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/discussion/294993) and our previous [research paper: Emergent Collective Intelligence from Massive-Agent Cooperation and Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01609) for how a image-like controller can work.\n","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nfrom typing import Any, Dict\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.typing as npt\nfrom gym import spaces\n\n\n# Controller class copied here since you won't have access to the luxai_s2 package directly on the competition server\nclass Controller:\n    def __init__(self, action_space: spaces.Space) -> None:\n        self.action_space = action_space\n\n    def action_to_lux_action(\n        self, agent: str, obs: Dict[str, Any], action: npt.NDArray\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Takes as input the current \"raw observation\" and the parameterized action and returns\n        an action formatted for the Lux env\n        \"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError()\n\n    def action_masks(self, agent: str, obs: Dict[str, Any]):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a boolean action mask indicating in each discrete dimension whether it would be valid or not\n        \"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError()\n\n\nclass SimpleUnitDiscreteController(Controller):\n    def __init__(self, env_cfg) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        A simple controller that controls only the robot that will get spawned.\n        Moreover, it will always try to spawn one heavy robot if there are none regardless of action given\n\n        For the robot unit\n        -

Transforming Lux S2 into a Single Phase\n\nNormally RL frameworks like Stable Baselines 3, RLlib, Tianshou etc. expect the action space and observation space to be consistent throughout an episode. Lux S2 does not conform to this as we add some additional complexity like bidding and factory placement phases. A simple way to get around this is to **upgrade the reset function.**\n\nPreviously we saw that `env.reset()` resets an environment to a clean slate. We will upgrade this function by building a environment wrapper that not only resets to the clean slate, but also handles the bidding and factory placement phases so effectively agents that are learning start from game states with factories already placed.\n\nBelow will build a wrapper that works with the SB3 package. To do this, we want to provide the wrapper a bidding policy and factory placement policy which will be used by all teams to handle the first two phases in the reset function. The code below does just that by overriding the environment's reset function in the wrapper. \n\nFurthermore, we want to use the Controller we defined earlier, so that is also an argument to the SB3Wrapper and we use it to transform actions inside the `env.step` function","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install luxai_s2","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-22T12:53:07.341791Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-22T12:53:07.342292Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-22T12:53:19.349576Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-22T12:53:07.342254Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-22T12:53:19.347432Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Requirement already satisfied: luxai_s2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (2.1.8)\nRequirement already satisfied: pettingzoo in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (1.22.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: pygame in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (2.1.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: vec-noise in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (1.1.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (1.21.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: gym==0.21.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (0.21.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: termcolor in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (1.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata<5.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (4.13.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: scipy in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (1.7.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: matplotlib in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from luxai_s2) (3.5.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: cloudpickle>=1.2.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from gym==0.21.0->luxai_s2) (2.1.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from importlib-metadata<5.0->luxai_s2) (3.8.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.6.4 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from importlib-metadata<5.0->luxai_s2) (4.5.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pillow>=6.2.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (9.1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.0.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (1.4.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (0.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.2.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (3.0.9)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (23.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (2.8.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from matplotlib->luxai_s2) (4.33.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: gymnasium>=0.26.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pettingzoo->luxai_s2) (0.27.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: gymnasium-notices>=0.0.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from gymnasium>=0.26.0->pettingzoo->luxai_s2) (0.0.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: jax-jumpy>=0.2.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from gymnasium>=0.26.0->pettingzoo->luxai_s2) (0.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7->matplotlib->luxai_s2) (1.15.0)\n\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

On CPU this training can take around 3-4 hours to train, on GPU it can take 30min to an hour to train. The hyperparameters and reward function can be improved to make it train much faster. A simple way to also increase training speed is to train on a machine with more CPU cores and increasing `num_envs` above. Kaggle notebooks by default only have 4, but with e.g. 10 you can easily train a policy in around 30 minutes.\n\nIf you want to skip this training you can also just use the pretrained model that's in the downloaded dataset for the RL kit called `best_model.dontunzipme`. (kaggle auto unzips files but we need to keep it as a zip so the file extention is called .dontunzipme but for submission just change it to a .zip)\n\nTo track the progress we recommend using tensorboard which you can run with\n```\ntensorboard --logdir logs\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-22T13:30:15.831119Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-22T13:30:15.831683Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-22T13:30:15.865775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-22T13:30:15.831648Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-22T13:30:15.863551Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipykernel_27/245875834.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtotal_timesteps\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m10_000_000\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 5\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0meval_callback\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mEvalCallback\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0meval_env\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbest_model_save_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlog_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlog_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlog_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m \u001b[0mcheckpoint_callback\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mCheckpointCallback\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0msave_freq\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1e5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0msave_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlog_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      7\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmodel\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mPPO\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mpolicy\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0menv\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mverbose\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtensorboard_log\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlog_path\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'eval_env' is not defined"],"ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'eval_env' is not defined","output_type":"error"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"total_timesteps = 10_000_000\nmodel.learn(\n    total_timesteps,\n    callback=[TensorboardCallback(tag=\"train_metrics\"), eval_callback],\n)\nmodel.save(osp.join(log_path, \"models/latest_model\"))","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-22T13:37:44.165595Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-22T13:37:44.166180Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-22T13:37:44.200383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-22T13:37:44.166128Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-22T13:37:44.198415Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mAttributeError\u001b[0m                            Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipykernel_27/3377558824.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[0mtotal_timesteps\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m10_000_000\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 2\u001b[0;31m model.learn(\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mtotal_timesteps\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mcallback\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0mTensorboardCallback\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mtag\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"train_metrics\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0meval_callback\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m )\n","\u001b[0;31mAttributeError\u001b[0m: 'LinearRegression' object has no attribute 'learn'"],"ename":"AttributeError","evalue":"'LinearRegression' object has no attribute 'learn'","output_type":"error"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Packaging and Submission\n\nWe now have a trained policy. In order to make it submittable to the competition we recommend you write code on separate files and only use kaggle notebooks for training as it can get very messy to program an RL agent just using a Kaggle notebook interface. The starter kit that was downloaded earlier has all of the code above written already and organized into separate files and folders. The observation wrapper and controller written here are saved to the `wrappers` folder. The SB3Wrapper is not in the kit, but is a part of the official luxai_s2 package and you can import it with\n\n```\nfrom luxai_s2.wrappers import SB3Wrapper\n```\n\nThe main file to take note of is `agent.py` which defines your agent's behavior. It will load the policy from`MODEL_WEIGHTS_RELATIVE_PATH` which can be changed at the top of `agent.py`.\n\n`agent.py` also uses the actions_mask function to invalidate some actions so that the policy only generates valid actions, which is a easy way to improve performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# if running on kaggle, run below to copy the rl starter kit files to the working directory\n!cp -r ../input/luxai-s2-rl-sb3-kit/* .\n!mv best_model.dontunzipme best_model.zip # kaggle auto unzips files but we don't want it to here so we do this","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-22T13:40:49.890003Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-22T13:40:49.890532Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-22T13:40:52.193537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-22T13:40:49.890496Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-22T13:40:52.191595Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# if you trained an actual agent, copy its model weights here\n!mv logs/exp_1/models/best_model.zip best_model.zip","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-22T13:41:07.919575Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-22T13:41:07.920126Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-22T13:41:09.025903Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-22T13:41:07.920082Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-22T13:41:09.024495Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"mv: cannot stat 'logs/exp_1/models/best_model.zip': No such file or directory\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nTo submit your trained agent create a .tar.gz file.

A simple improvement would be to add lichen planting to the action space / controller or program it directly as a rule in the agent.py file, allowing you to score points by the end of the game as well as generate more power.\n\nAnother easy idea is to modify the `agent.py` code so that you spawn multiple factories and multiple heavy robots, and simply run the trained policy on each heavy robot.\n\n\nIf you want to look into more scalable solutions, it's critical to first figure out how to model multiple units at once. This kit shows you how to control a single heavy robot effectively but not multiple. Another thing to consider is what observations and features would be the most useful. Finally, you can always try and develop a more complex action controller in addition to developing better reward functions.\n\nIf you feel you are experienced enough, you can take a look at [last season's winning solution by team Toad Brigade](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/discussion/294993) or [our paper: Emergent collective intelligence from massive-agent cooperation and competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01609) which show how to use convolutional neural nets and various other techniques (e.g. invalid action masking) to control a massive number of units at once.","metadata":{}}]}
